Once we have a repository, we’ll probably want to add some files to it. 
In order to do this, we’ll take our newly created remote repository and create a copy,
 or clone, of it as a local repository on our computer.
Make sure you have git installed on your computer by typing git into your terminal.
 If it is not installed, you can download it here.
Click the green “Clone or Download” button on your repository’s page, and copy the url that pops down.
 If you didn’t create a README, this link will appear near the top of the page in the “Quick Setup” section.

In your terminal, run git clone <repository url>. 
This will download the repository to your computer.
 If you didn’t create a README, you will get the warning: 
You appear to have cloned into an empty repository.
 This is normal, and there’s no need to worry about it.
Run ls, which is a command that lists all files and folders in your current directory.
 You should see the name of the repository you’ve just cloned.
Run cd <repository name> to change directory into that folder.
Run touch <new file name> to create a new file in that folder. 
You can now make edits to that file. Alternatively,
 you can open the folder in your text editor and manually add new files.
Now, to let Git know that it should be keeping track of the new file you’ve made,
 Run git add <new file name> 
to track that specific file, or git add . to track all files within that directory.
